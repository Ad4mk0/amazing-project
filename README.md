# Amazing project

This might be the nuts and bolts for a new *Amazing project*.
Also a small challenege for me, to update this regularily :D.
Will feature more complex docker, sql, processing.


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ad4mk0/amazing-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd amazing-project
```

Run using docker:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```
